# TODO

+ Add a command that shows all the tickets you're watching

+ Add an "unwatch ticket" command

+ Add a command to re-assign tickets

+ Add labels to tickets

+ Modify `jira-get-issue-status` so the YAML is editable in `EDITOR`
  and can be passed back to JIRA with updates of all important info:
  description, status, etc.
